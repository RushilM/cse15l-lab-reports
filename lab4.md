## Lab Report 4

*Step 4*
Step 4 is logging in ieng6. In order to do this we must use the ssh command. I have the ssh command copied in notes so I know that it is ```ssh cs15lfa23er@ieng6.ucsd.edu``` because we the password has been set up previously we will not be prompted for a password. 
Keys Pressed: ```<CTRL-C><CTRL-V><ENTER>```
